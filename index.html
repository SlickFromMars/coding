        <h2>What is Coding?</h2>
        In coding, you will be tested on your knowledge of various coding languages through an exam. You can study and
        prepare for this all year in order to score well. If you score higher than enough teams, you will make it to
        semifinals. When your team of 2 makes it to semifinals, you will participate in a coding challenge. This usually
        consists of 5 prompts that you need to follow, and program, in the language of your choice.
